**Project Name: Employee Database Management**

**Description:**
The Employee Database Management project involves designing a database schema to store employee data from CSV files, importing the data into a SQL database, and performing various data analysis queries. The project aims to gain insights into employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s, their departments, salaries, and other related information.

**Table Schema Creation:**
1. **departments** table:
   - dept_no (VARCHAR(4)) - Primary Key
   - dept_name (VARCHAR(100))

2. **dept_manager** table:
   - dept_no (VARCHAR(4)) - Foreign Key to departments.dept_no
   - emp_no (INT) - Foreign Key to employees.emp_no

3. **dept_emp** table:
   - emp_no (INT) - Foreign Key to employees.emp_no
   - dept_no (VARCHAR(4)) - Foreign Key to departments.dept_no

4. **employees** table:
   - emp_no (INT) - Primary Key
   - emp_title_id (VARCHAR(10)) - Foreign Key to titles.title_id
   - birth_date (DATE)
   - first_name (VARCHAR(50))
   - last_name (VARCHAR(50))
   - sex (CHAR(1))
   - hire_date (DATE)

5. **titles** table:
   - title_id (VARCHAR(10)) - Primary Key
   - title (VARCHAR(100))

6. **salaries** table:
   - emp_no (INT) - Foreign Key to employees.emp_no
   - salary (INT)

**Uploading CSV Files:**
1. Import the 'departments.csv' file into the departments table.
2. Import the 'dept_manager.csv' file into the dept_manager table.
3. Import the 'dept_emp.csv' file into the dept_emp table.
4. Import the 'employees.csv' file into the employees table, converting the date format to match SQL date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
5. Import the 'titles.csv' file into the titles table.
6. Import the 'salaries.csv' file into the salaries table.

**Modifying Date in employees.csv:**
To match the date format with SQL date format, follow these steps:
1. Open the employees.csv file in a text editor or spreadsheet application.
2. Locate the 'birth_date' and 'hire_date' columns.
3. Rearrange the dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD." For example, change "7/25/1953" to "1953-07-25."
4. Save the modified CSV file.
